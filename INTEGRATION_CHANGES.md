# Frontend-Backend Integration Changes

## Summary
Removed all hardcoded data from frontend settings pages and integrated with real backend endpoints.

## Database Changes

### New Tables Created
1. **audit_logs** - Tracks security events and system activities
   - Columns: id, event, user_email, user_id, ip_address, severity, details, created_at
   
2. **notifications** - Stores notification history
   - Columns: id, type, message, status, recipient_email, recipient_id, created_at

### New Settings Seeded
- Integration settings (paypal, stripe, mailchimp, zoom, youtube, facebook, google, slack)
- System settings (maxUploadSize, sessionTimeout)
- Security settings (twoFactorRequired, passwordExpiry, minPasswordLength, etc.)
- Notification settings (emailEnabled, smsEnabled, pushEnabled, etc.)

## Backend Changes

### New Endpoints Added
1. **POST /api/settings/notifications/test-email** - Test SMTP configuration
2. **POST /api/settings/integrations/:integration/test** - Test integration connection

### Updated Endpoints
1. **GET /api/settings/security/logs** - Now returns real audit logs from database
2. **GET /api/settings/security/stats** - Calculates real security metrics
3. **GET /api/settings/notifications/recent** - Returns real notifications from database
4. **GET /api/settings/integrations/stats** - Calculates real integration statistics
5. **POST /api/settings/bulk** - Now supports JSON values for complex settings

### Controller Updates
- `settingsController.js` - All mock data replaced with database queries
- Added audit logging for test operations
- Added notification tracking for test emails

## Frontend Changes

### Removed Hardcoded Data
1. **SecuritySettings.tsx**
   - Removed hardcoded security logs array
   - Now fetches real data from `/api/settings/security/logs`

2. **NotificationSettings.tsx**
   - Integrated test email functionality with backend
   - Now fetches real recent notifications

3. **IntegrationSettings.tsx**
   - Integrated test integration functionality with backend
   - Removed API key management section (not needed)
   - Now fetches real integration stats

### Hook Updates
- `useSettings.ts` - Added `testEmail()` and `testIntegration()` methods

## Migration Files
- `018_create_audit_logs.sql` - Audit logs table
- `019_create_notifications.sql` - Notifications table
- `021_seed_initial_data.sql` - Initial settings and sample data
- `run-new.js` - Script to run only new migrations

## What Still Uses Mock Data (Intentionally)
These components have hardcoded data that should be replaced when their respective backend endpoints are fully implemented:

### Member Dashboard
- Overview stats (attendance, giving, events attended)
- Recent sermons list
- Upcoming events list
- Giving history
- Prayer requests (personal and community)

These will be integrated once the corresponding backend endpoints are created for:
- `/api/dashboard/member-stats/:memberId`
- `/api/sermons?limit=3`
- `/api/events?upcoming=true&limit=3`
- `/api/giving/history/:memberId`
- `/api/prayers/member/:memberId`
- `/api/prayers/community`

## Testing
To test the changes:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to Settings page as admin
4. Test each tab:
   - General Settings - Save church information
   - System Settings - View system status
   - Security Settings - View real security logs and stats
   - Notification Settings - Test email functionality
   - Integration Settings - Enable/disable integrations and test connections

## Next Steps
1. Implement member dashboard backend endpoints
2. Add real-time security monitoring
3. Implement actual email sending (currently just logs to database)
4. Add webhook handlers for external integrations
5. Implement security settings enforcement in auth middleware
